# Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- An AI coding CLI — [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), Gemini CLI, Codex, Qwen Code, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI, Antigravity CLI, or Grok Build CLI (see [Supported CLIs](SUPPORTED_CLIS.md))
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+ and `git` (`npx` ships with Node — the installer refuses to run without them) — note: the Gemini CLI integration requires Node.js 20+
- (Optional) Go 1.21+ (for the dashboard TUI)

## Quick Start

### This checkout

This is an existing checkout — there's nothing to install. Just open your AI CLI in this folder:

```bash
claude   # or codex / qwen / opencode / agy / grok
```

**On first launch, career-ops walks you through setup by chatting** — it asks for your CV, your details (name, target roles, salary), and sets up the job scanner with pre-configured companies. Nothing to edit by hand: just answer its questions. Then paste a job offer URL or description and it evaluates it, writes a report, generates a tailored PDF, and tracks it.

If you are using Codex, start the interactive session with `codex`. Slash commands are not guaranteed in Codex, so use the same mode names in a prompt if `/career-ops` is unavailable:

```text
Evaluate this JD with career-ops auto-pipeline: https://company.com/jobs/123
Run the career-ops scan mode.
Run the career-ops pipeline mode.
Run the career-ops pdf mode.
Run the career-ops email mode for the latest evaluated role. Draft only; never sends, submits, or clicks.
Run the career-ops tracker mode.
```

For one-shot workers or batch tasks in Codex, use `codex exec`. See [docs/CODEX.md](CODEX.md) for the full guide.

```bash
codex exec "Evaluate this JD with career-ops auto-pipeline: https://company.com/jobs/123"
codex exec "Run career-ops scan mode in this repo."
codex exec "Run career-ops pipeline mode for data/pipeline.md."
codex exec "Run career-ops pdf mode for the latest evaluated role."
codex exec "Run career-ops email mode for the latest evaluated role. Draft only; do not send, submit, or click anything."
codex exec "Run career-ops tracker mode and summarize the current statuses."
```

### Setting up a fresh checkout elsewhere

<details>
<summary>Cloning career-ops onto a new machine or into a new folder?</summary>

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd career-ops
npm install
```

Then open your AI CLI in the folder — the same first-run onboarding applies. This checkout already has its dependencies installed; use this pattern only when starting a new one somewhere else.

### PDF rendering (one-time)

PDFs are rendered with a headless Chromium. Install it once per machine:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```
